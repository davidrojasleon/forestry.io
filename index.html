          <h2><span class="light"><strong>About </strong>the MCC Tool</span></h2>
          <p><strong>Multiple Chronic Conditions<br></strong>Rates of multimorbidity are rising globally. Overall, 42% of adults have multiple chronic conditions (MCC); that number rises to over 80% of those over 65 years of age. In the United States, patients with multiple chronic conditions account for an estimated 70% of all healthcare spending. Health systems have responded to this increasing burden by implementing financial and clinical innovations to improve quality and keep costs under control.Gaps in what is known about the global MCC burden persist. For example, much of what is studied focuses on older adults, while there has been less research on younger adults and those who live in low- and middle-income countries. In addition, while there is some evidence regarding the most common clusters of chronic conditions in a given area, less is known about the myriad ways multimorbidity can occur in a patient or group of patients.<br><br><strong>The MCC Tool<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br></span></strong>A standard methodology to evaluate the prevalence and associated costs of patients with multiple chronic conditions could be beneficial to health systems, researchers, and governments as they implement new care models and financial incentives to achieve quality and cost goals. We designed a tool to help determine which segments of a given population have specific multiple chronic conditions. The main purpose is to provide health systems analysts with a simple descriptive method that can be applied to any population for whom medical claims data are available. Importantly, this tool allows the exploration of multimorbidity without any assumptions (i.e. that may come from more complex statistical or machine learning techniques) or demographic limitations.<br><br>In addition, it can help sort health systems data by prevalence and attributed spending of multiple chronic conditions. The key functionality of this tool lies in defining, navigating, and sorting <strong>‘segments’ </strong>within a population. Here we define ‘Segments’ as a group of patients defined by 1 or 2 chronic conditions, an age group, and legal sex (‘M’ or ‘F’, as represented in insurance claims data). These fields are commonly found in existing insurance claim data sets.</p>

        <h2><span class="light"><strong>FAQ</strong></span></h2>
        <p><strong>How do I generate chronic disease categories for this tool?<br></strong>We have built this tool to be readily compatible with the ICD-9 diagnosis code: chronic disease category mapping available from the <a href="https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/chronic/chronic.jsp"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project</span></a>. What does this mean? If you have data that attributes an <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9cm.htm" title="">ICD-9 diagnosis code</a> to patients, you can group similar diagnoses together into a broader chronic disease category. For example, diagnosis code 250.52 (“Diabetes with ophthalmic manifestations, type II or unspecified type, uncontrolled”) and 250.00 (“Diabetes mellitus without mention of complication, type II or unspecified type, not stated as uncontrolled”) would be grouped together into the chronic disease category ‘Type II Diabetes Mellitus’.<br><br><strong>What format does my healthcare data need to be in? <br></strong>In order to utilize this tool, you need to aggregate claims data by member-year. This means that each row in your data should represent a single member in a single year of utilization. If you are working with a different type of healthcare data (from an Electronic Health Record system, or an epidemiologic survey), you would want each row of your data to represent a unique individual in a given year. The below table gives a simplistic overview of what this could look like:<br><br>TABLE HERE<br><br><strong>How should I go about generating segments?<br></strong>Utilize SampleSegmentation.ipynb with your existing data to generate a sample set of segments and visualizations. Leave an issue on the github page or contact <strong>usnishm@gmail.com</strong> if you have any additional questions.<br><br><strong>What should I do if I have problems?<br></strong>If you are having problems or have found a bug in the code, please raise an issue on the Github page here: <a href="https://github.com/usnish/MCC_cluster_tool/issues" title="https://github.com/usnish/MCC_cluster_tool/issues"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">https://github.com/usnish/MCC_cluster_tool/issues</span></a></p>
